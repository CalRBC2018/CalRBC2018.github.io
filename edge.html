I am part of the Peer Review Board which is an organisation that deals with policy violations in the residence halls. I am also doing some interesting psychological research at our law school. I look forward to seeing and interacting with all of you (both virtually, through the (rather lengthy) registration form, and also in person, of course). I am very excited for the conference and really looking forward to February! </div>
